## Math Functions ##
There are more than what is listed below, but these are what we will mostly be using in our project

COUNT:
 - Counts the sumber of rows returned using the current constraints (WHERE clause)

 SELECT COUNT(i.amount) AS Count
 FROM ingredient i


AVG (Average):
 - Computes the average of a column across all selected rows

 SELECT AVG(i.amount) AS Average
 FROM ingredient i


SUM:
 - Computes the sum of a column across all selected rows

 SELECT SUM(i.amount) AS Sum
 FROM ingredient i


MIN:
 - Computes the minimum value of a column across all selected rows

 SELECT MIN(i.amount) AS Min
 FROM ingredient i


MAX:
 - Computes the maximum value of a column across all selected rows

 SELECT MAX(i.amount) AS Max
 FROM ingredient i


## String Functions ##
There are more than what is listed below, but these are what we will mostly be using in our project

CONCAT:
 - Concatenates two or more strings/column values together

 SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(i.amount, ' ', u.unit_name_plural) AS Amount
 FROM ingredient i
 INNER JOIN unit u USING (unit_id)
 WHERE u.unit_name_plural LIKE 'ou%'

 This will return a list of all the ingredients and their amounts, but the amounts will be in the format of "amount unit_name_plural" (e.g. "5 ounces", "2 ounces", etc.)


UPPER:
 - Converts and then returns a string to all uppercase

 SELECT UPPER(r.recipe_name) AS 'Name Upper'
 FROM recipe r


LOWER:
 - Converts and then returns a string to all lowercase

 SELECT LOWER(r.recipe_name) AS 'Name Lower'
 FROM recipe r


## Date/Time Functions ##
There are more than what is listed below, but these are what we will mostly be using in our project

CURRENT_TIMESTAMP:
 - Returns the current date and time
 - Same as NOW()

 SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS Now

 Returns: 2023-01-01 00:00:00 (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)


CURDATE:
 - Returns the current date

 SELECT CURDATE() AS Today

 Returns: 2023-01-01 (YYYY-MM-DD)


CURTIME:
 - Returns the current time

 SELECT CURTIME() AS Now

 Returns: 00:00:00 (HH:MM:SS)
