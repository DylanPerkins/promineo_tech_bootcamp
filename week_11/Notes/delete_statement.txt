### DELETE Syntax ###

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE constraint;

Deleting Child Rows:
 - When a recipe is deleted, all of the child rows will be deleted as well.
   - ingredient
   - step
   - recipe_category
 - This is because of the foreign key constraints that we have set up used ON DELETE CASCADE.

# Example #

    DELETE FROM recipe
    WHERE recipe_id = 1;
