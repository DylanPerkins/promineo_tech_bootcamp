### Many to Many Recap ###

A many to many relationship requires a join table. Each main table has a PK (Primary Key) and each join table has two FKs (Foreign Keys). 

Example: 

Recipe Table:
 - recipe_id (PK)
 - recipe_name

Category Table:
 - category_id (PK)
 - category_name

Recipe_Category Table:
 - recipe_id (FK)
 - category_id (FK)

Creating Table (Many to many):
 
 CREATE TABLE recipe_category (
    recipe_id INT NOT NULL,
    category_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (recipe_id, category_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (recipe_id) REFERENCES recipe(recipe_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
 );


Implementation for this project:
 - MySQL will not fill in the FK values when we add a new row to recipe_category
 - The client will enter:
   - The recipe id
   - The category name
 - The application will then look up the category id
 - We will use a subquery for this
