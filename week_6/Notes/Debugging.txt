What is Debugging?

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program 
that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. 

Vocabulary:

 - Debugger: A program that allows you to step through a program one line at a time, 
   and examine the values of variables and the state of the program at any point in time.
 - Breakpoint: A point in a program where the debugger will stop the program and allow you to 
   examine the state of the program.
 - Stack trace: A list of the functions that are currently active in the program.
 - Traceback: A list of the functions that were active when an exception occurred.
 - Exception: An error that is detected while a program is running.
 - Error: An error that is detected while a program is being compiled.
 - Syntax error: An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse (and therefore impossible to interpret).
 - Semantic error: An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.
 - Runtime error: An error that does not occur until after the program has started running.
 - Logic error: An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.
