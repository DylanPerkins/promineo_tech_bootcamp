Unit Testing is one of the most effective ways to test code.

During Unit Testing, the code is broken into Units, smaller pieces of functionality, and those 
units are tested extensively. This is one way that a software developer can find issues in 
their initial implementation, and then as the code is modified, to ensure that nothing has 
broken a previously correct implementation.
