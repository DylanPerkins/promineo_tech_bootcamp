MySQL supports all SQL data types

Whole number types:
 - TINYINT
    - 1 byte
    - 8 bits
    - Java Type: byte
 - SMALLINT
    - 2 bytes
    - 16 bits
    - Java Type: short
 - MEDIUMINT
    - 3 bytes
    - 24 bits
 - INT
    - 4 bytes
    - 32 bits
    - Java Type: int
 - BIGINT
    - 8 bytes
    - 64 bits
    - Java Type: long
Unlike Java, INT's can be signed or unsigned.

Fixed precision type (DECIMAL):
 - DECIMALs are defined with precision and scale
 - Precision is the total number of digits stored (including the decimal point)
 - Scale is the number of digits after the decimal point
 - Example: DECIMAL(5,2) stores values from -999.99 to 999.99
 - DECIMAL numbers are exact and can be used for money
 - The Java class that corresponds to DECIMAL is java.math.BigDecimal, not double or float
 - DECIMALs may have round off errors, but they do not accumulate

Date and Time types:
 - DATETIME
    - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
 - TIMESTAMP
    - Converted to and stored as UTC
    - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
 - DATE
    - YYYY-MM-DD
 - TIME
    - HH:MM:SS
 - YEAR
    - YYYY or YY

Character types:
 - CHAR
    - Fixed length
    - Up to 255 characters
 - VARCHAR
    - Variable length
    - Up to 255 characters
 - TINYTEXT
    - Up to 255 (2^8) characters
 - TEXT
    - Up to 65,535 (2^16) characters
 - MEDIUMTEXT
    - Up to 16,777,215 (2^24) characters
 - LONGTEXT
    - Up to 4,294,967,295 (2^32) characters

Enumerated types:
 - ENUM
    - A list of up to 65,535 values
    - Each value is assigned a number from 1 to n
    - The number is stored in the database
    - Example: ENUM('one', 'two', 'three'), the column must contain one of these three values

Boolean type:
 - BOOLEAN
    - Synonym for TINYINT(1)
    - 0 is false, 1 is true
    - Equivalent to TINYINT(1) 
        - Note that the (1) is a disaply width
        - Does not affect the storage size

Data:
 - When a table is created, columns can be declared NOT NULL, so the row must have 
 a value for that column.  
 - Columns can also be declared as NULL, so the row may have no value in that column. (un-nullable)
 - If a column is not declared with NULL or NOT NULL, the column is nullable. 
 - DEFAULT supplies a vlaue if the inserted value is NULL
    - Often used in TIMESTAMP or DATETIME columns
