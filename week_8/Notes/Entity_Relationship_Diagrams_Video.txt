Mapping Tables

Definitions:
 - Cardinality: the maximum number of entities allowed in a relationship
    - One or Many
 - Modality: the minimum number of entities allowed in a relationship
    - Zero or One (optional or mandatory)

Crow's foot notation
 - Relationships are diagramed using the following notation
 - Relationships are bidirectional
 - A relationship line must have the crow's foot notation on both ends
   of the line
 - Each end must express cardinality and modality
 - Cardinality is shown at the end of the line
 - Modality is shown only within the line

 Cardinality             Modality             Notation
 One                     Mandatory            --|-|-
 One                     Optional             --o-|-
 Many                    Mandatory            ---|<-
 Many                    Optional             ---o<-

ERD Conventions:
 - Primary key columns are above the line and are designated with PK
 - Foreign key columns are below the line and are designated with FK
 Example: 
           Step
    PK   | step_id
    ------------------------
    FK   | recipe_id
    FK   | step_order
    FK   | step_text

Join tables are shown with dashes off of the main relationship line.

Naming Conventions - Columns:
 - Tables names and column names are lowercase with words separated by
   underscores
 - Common names should have the table name as a prefix
   - Example: Table = recipe, Column = recipe_name

Naming Conventions - Relationships:
 - Primary key columns are formed by adding "_id" on to the table name
   - Table recipe: recipe_id
   - Table ingredient: ingredient_id
   
 - Foreign key columns are named the same as the primary key column in the
   related table
   - Table recipe (primary key): recipe_id
   - Table step (foreign key): recipe_id
