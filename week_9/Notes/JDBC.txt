Parts of JDBC;
 - Connection:
   - Loads the driver
   - Establishes a TCP connection with the MySQL server 
 - Statement:
   - Queries or updates MySQL with SQL statements
   - Translated from SQL to MySQL dialect
 - ResultSet:
   - Contains results of a query
   - Only used in queries

Challenge of JDBC:
 - After obtaining a resource, it MUST be closed in a finally block
 - The close() method call must also be wrapped in a try-catch block
 - Resources are;
   - Connections
   - Statements
   - ResultSets
 - If resources are not closed, they will be leaked and the application will eventually crash

Try-with-resources:
 - The resource is initialized in the try clause itself
 - No need to write a finally block to close the resource
 - The complier automatically closes the resource after the try block ends
 Ex. 
    try(Connection conn = getConnection()) {
        startTransaction(conn);

        try(Statement stmt = conn.createStatement()) {
            try(ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql)){
                // Gather results
                commitTransaction(conn);
            }
        }
        catch(Exception e) {
            rollbackTransaction(conn);
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Handle the exception
    }
