Transmisson Control Protocol (TCP)
----------------------------------
A connection to MySQL is done with TCP

- Connects two computers together, like a circuit or a phone calls
- Is reliable, the data is guaranteed to arrive in the same order it was sent
- Is bidirectional, data can be sent in both directions
- Can have multiple connections between two computers open at the same time
- The connection remains open until it is explicitly closed
- When the connection is established, data is exchanged so that both sides agree on the 
data format, compression, encryption, etc.
- Establishing a connection is slow, but once established, data can be sent with very little overhead
- Connections can be reused and pooled (but not is they're closed)
- TCP is managed by computer hardware

Database Language:
------------------
Example: SQL (Structured Query Language)

- Each database has its own language (protocol) that it uses to communicate with clients
- The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) classes do not know the language of the database

Database Driver:
----------------
- The database driver works with the computer hardware to establish a reliable connection 
with the database server
- The MySQL driver "translates" the JDBC calls into the MySQL protocol

Driver Selection:
-----------------
- The driver is selected by the URL
- JDBC finds all the database drivers on the classpath
MySQL connection string format --> jdbc:mysql://hostname:port/schema
