What is Maven?
 - Maven is a project build tool
 - It will be used for dependency management

Creating a Spring Boot Project:
 - https://start.spring.io/
 - Build the POM file using the latest version for Spring Boot
 - Paste this into the POM file in the Maven project
 - Create the main application class file

Spring Boot Application Class:

 @SpringBootApplication
 public class PetParkApplication {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         SpringApplication.run(PetParkApplication.class, args);
     }
 }

What is @SpringBootApplication?
 - Enables component scanning
 - Enables auto configuration

What is component scanning?
 - Boot will look at every class in the package and sub packages
 - Determines if Spring should manage the class
   - Called a Spring Bean
   - Spring will create an instance of the class
   - Spring will stash it in an object repository
   - We can request an instance using @Autowired
 - We'll write a controller class
 - Spring's component scan will map HTTP requests to methods that we will also write
 - We can use annotations to tell Spring which HTTP verb to map to the method

What is Auto-Configuration?
 - Spring Boot examines the classpath and then application configuration
 - It sets up functionality (Web Application) based on what it finds
 - Spring creates a Web Application if it finds the Tomcat dependency
 - Tomcat is loaded by spring-boot-starter-web
